# Systemd::Timer::DateTime will match only normalized forms of systemd.time (see man page systemd.time)
# along with the special forms that include asterisks for "every", such as *-*-* as every day or Mon *-*-* for every
# Monday.  In its present form, it doesn't match some of the special phrases that can be used with a timer.
