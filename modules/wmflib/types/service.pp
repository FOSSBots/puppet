# @type Wmflib::service
# Define all data pertaining to a service.
# Of specific interest might be the "state", which represent the status in a
# state machine of the specific service we're declaring.
# @param [String] description
#     The description of the service
# @param Array[String] sites
#     The list of the datacenters where the service is active
# @param [Hash[String, Wmflib::Service::Ipblock]] ip
#     Hash of site names and corresponding LVS IPs.
# @param [Stdlib::Port] port
#     The IP port on which the service is exposed
# @param [Boolean] encryption
#     Whether the service uses TLS or not.
# @param [Wmflib::Service::Lvs] lvs
#     A collection of information on the load-balancing of the service
# @param [Optional[Wmflib::Service::Monitoring]] monitoring
#     A collection of information on the monitoring of the service.
# @param Enum state
#     State on the state machine of installation of the service.
#     Specifically:
#     - service_setup means we need the declaration to be present for setting up the
#     service on real servers
#     - lvs_setup means we need the declaration to be present for setting up lvs
#     - monitoring_setup means we want to introduce monitoring, but we still don't
#     want to page.
#     - finally production means the setup is complete and live in production.
# @param Optional[Array] Array of discovery records related to the current service, if any
#
